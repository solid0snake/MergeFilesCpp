# Merge Files Cpp
Given three text files, each of which contains a sorted list of integers (one integer per line) in ascending order, this program merges these input files into another file in which all the numbers remain their sorted order. Finally, it informs the user the name of the merged file.
The user will input the name of three files. Keep in mind that the three input files must be located in the same folder as this program.
